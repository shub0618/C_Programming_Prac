Variable names in C Language are the names given to locations in memory. 
These locations can be an integer, characters, or real constants. 
In addition, a variable type can only hold the same constant type. In this lesson, we will learn how to work with Variables in C Programming.

Rules for Variable naming

1.The first character in a variable name must be an underscore or alphabet
2.A variable name is a combination of alphabets 1 to 31, digits, or underscores.
3.No comma is allowed in a variable name.
4.In addition, no blank space is valid.
Always try to create meaningful names. For example, the variable names for calculating the results of students can be given variable name results.

Variable Declaration
Declaration of a variable in C language is quite easy. The following is the syntax showing how to declare variables in C programming,

datatype varlist;
 
The valid variable declaration examples are shown below. Here, int, char, and float are datatypes,

int result;
int marks_one, marks_two;
 
char s = ‘P’;
char name;
 
float points;
 
The preceding examples show how a variable is declared, wherein a datatype precedes the variable name.
